Citi Bike Data July 2019
- I created a bubble map to show which stations are used most often
- After looking at Male vs. Female there is a lot of discrepancy on gender. I believe this is due to users not putting in accurate information or declining to answer.
- The birth years are inaccurate. I believe this would be a result of users entering false information.
- The average trip duration varies by gender and birth year.
